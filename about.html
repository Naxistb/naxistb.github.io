        <br/>
        I'm fascinated by malwares since i'm 9, and i think its passionating as a subject.
        <br/>
        Every malware is different than another, some are funny, some are scary, and think its passionating.
        <br/>
        I started testing malwares samples when i was 9, on VM's, some of my early videos were made when i was 10, and it still fascinates me today.
        <br/>
        Some malwares are really hard to find, because many malwares collectors have a big ego and don't want to help searching for samples, even though they have it.
        <br/>
        I will share every malware I have on my GitHub page, the GitHub page is still in developement.
        <br/>
        Sadly, a lot of people don't appreciate malwares and try to eliminate them from the internet.
        <br/>
        Remember : Do not test malwares on your host ! Always use a VM.
