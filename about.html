    <p id="msg">My channel is based on technology and malwares and a bit of gaming sometimes.</p>
    <p id="msg" style="font-style: oblique;font-size:25px;" >Why do i make malwares videos?</p>
    <p id="msg">Because malware is an art!
        <br/>
        I'm fascinated by malwares since i'm 9, and i think its a really interesting subject.
        <br/>
        Every malware is different than another, some are funny, some are scary, and think its passionating.
        <br/>
        I started testing malwares samples when i was 9, on VM's, some of my early videos were made when i was 10, and it still fascinates me today.
        <br/>
        Some malwares are really hard to find, because many malwares collectors have a big ego and don't want to help searching for samples, even though they have it.
        <br/>
        I will share every malware I have on my GitHub page, the GitHub page is still in developement.
        <br/>
        Sadly, a lot of people don't appreciate malwares and try to eliminate them from the internet.
        <br/>
        Remember : Do not test malwares on your host ! It may break something, always use a VM.

    <p id="msg" style="font-style: oblique;font-size:25px;">What PC do I have?</p>
    <p>
    <br/>    
    This question is asked a lot on TikTok!
    </br>
    My PC is a Lenovo Ideapad gaming 3.
    </br>
    Here are the specs:
    <br/>
    CPU :
    <br/>
    GPU : Integrated : Real GPU :
    <br>
    SSDs : Intel SSDPEKNW512G8L and Crucial C1000BX500SSD1
    <br/>
    RAM : 16GB DDR4
    <br>
    It supports 5ghz wifi and the integrated screen is a 1920x1080 screen @120hz. Colors are great
    <br/>
    It's a great pc overall, overheats a lot but i think its cuz of my desk. I just do the thermal paste once every 6 months to make sure its good.
